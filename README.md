### Hey Gaba, I know you want to figure this out
I am going to try to explain this simply so you know what to do... you don't have to understand any of the code or anything of what's going on all you need to know is:
- how to start the project (show others locally)
- how to build the project (compressed down to the html and js files)

### Start the project
To start the project, you are going to have to open the terminal in the root folder of this project and type this in the command line:
```
$ npm i
```
This will make you install all the packages you need to see this in your machine immediately

After that, all you need to do is 
```
$ npm start
```
This should run the project on localhost:3000, and you can play around with it, take screen shots etc.

### Build the project
To build the project, you are going to have to open the terminal in the root folder of this project and type this in the command line:
```
npm i && npm build
```
This should install any dependencies (just in case) and set you up with the standard html and js files along with any images already organized and compressed into folders. All of this should appear in a folder called build in the root folder of this project.

### Questions
Just text ya boi and we'll figure it out together :)
